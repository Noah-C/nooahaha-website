  <p>From midsummer 2018 until the pandemic, I lived across the Charles and crossed the John W. Weeks Footbridge almost every day to reach Harvard’s main campus. At some point—I can no longer remember when—I began to pause at the bridge’s midpoint and photograph the bridge next to it, the Anderson Memorial Bridge.</p>
  <p>Before I moved away, I made more than two hundred images from that single vantage point, each preserving a fragment of light, weather, and season. Together they form a quiet chronicle of a place both constant and ever‑changing.</p>
