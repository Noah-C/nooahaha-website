  <h3>Anderson Memorial Bridge &mdash; A Project about Time</h3>
  <p>Since mid-summer 2018, I lived across the Charles River and crossed the John W. Weeks Footbridge almost every day to reach Harvard’s main campus. At some point — I can’t recall exactly when — I began to pause at the footbridge’s center line, photographing the bridge beside it, which I later learned was the Anderson Memorial Bridge.</p>
  <p>Until the pandemic, when I moved away, I took more than two hundred images from this fixed vantage point, each preserving a fragment of light, weather, and season. Together they form a quiet chronicle of a place both constant and ever-changing.</p>
