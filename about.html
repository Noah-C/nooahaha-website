<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Yedong Sh-Chen.</p>
<p>I study games, digital media, and modern China.</p>
<p>I'm completing a <a href="https://ealc.fas.harvard.edu/people/yedong-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ph.D. at Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>My dissertation, "Chinese Video Games: World, Object, and Artificial Intelligence," provides the first archive-based history of digital gaming in China since the 1970s, addressing key theoretical issues including world-building, artificial affect, AI ethics, and the politics of play, gender, and pleasure.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a side project about the history of computer graphics in East Asia.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I help the Harvard-Yenching Library collect games.</p>
<p>I used to be a stage actor in China and off-Broadway.</p>
<p>Now I live in Cambridge with my partner who's running a cool startup.</p>
