<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Yedong Sh-Chen.</p>
<p>I study games, digital media, AI, and modern China.</p>
<p>I'm completing a <a href="https://ealc.fas.harvard.edu/people/yedong-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ph.D. at Harvard</a>, and am getting a Professional Certificate in Game Design from MIT.</p>
<p>My dissertation, "Chinese Video Games: World, Object, and Artificial Intelligence," provides the first archive-based, transnational history of digital gaming in China and across the global Sinosphere, from the pixel era to the age of generative AI. It addresses key theoretical issues including world-building, artificial affect, AI ethics, and the politics of play, gender, and pleasure.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a side project to excavate the overlooked contributions of East Asian countries to the invention of computer graphics.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I help the Harvard-Yenching Library collect games.</p>
<p>I used to be a stage actor in China and off-Broadway.</p>
<p>Now I'm concerned about play and role-play in the age of generative AI.
