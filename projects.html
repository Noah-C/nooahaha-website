    <p>Since mid-summer 2018, I lived across the Charles River and crossed the John W. Weeks Footbridge almost every day to reach Harvard’s main campus. At some point — I can’t recall exactly when — I began to pause at the footbridge’s center line, photographing the bridge beside it, which I later learned was the Anderson Memorial Bridge.</p>
    <p>Until the pandemic, when I moved away, I took more than two hundred images from this fixed vantage point, each preserving a fragment of light, weather, and season. Together they form a quiet chronicle of a place both constant and ever-changing.</p>

    <p>“We must institute a library in which we must collect everything we possess relating to the customs of everyday life.” —Leon Trotsky, <em>Problems of Everyday Life</em></p>

    <p>2020 brought many people’s deepest fears into reality.</p>
    <p>There was unemployment, bankruptcies, mental collapse, illness, death, and—for many ordinary people still living—the endless dullness of domestic everyday life.</p>
    <p>The Russian term for this habitual, tedious everyday life is <i>byt</i>, a word usually translated into English as “everyday life” or “mode of life,” but once declared by Roman Jakobson “culturally untranslatable” into Western languages.</p>
    <p>Writer Anya von Bremzen interprets <i>byt</i> as “the metaphysical weight of the daily grind, the existentially depleting cares of material living.”</p>
    <p>Scholar Christina Kiaer explains <i>byt</i> as “the everyday life in its most mundane and material aspects, as opposed to higher forms of spiritual or philosophical existence.”</p>
    <p>According to Svetlana Boym, at least since the nineteenth century <i>byt</i> has been seen by many as a “fundamental feature of [Russian] culture,” signifying “everyday routine and stagnation,” as opposed to <i>bytie</i>, which refers to spiritual being—the “real” life found elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Russian avant‑garde artists’ contemplations on <i>byt</i>, on different ways of changing it, and particularly Dziga Vertov’s call for “a precise study of movement” and for reorganizing the movements of everyday objects “as a rhythmical whole” according to their “internal rhythm,” inspired me to create my own project The Rhythm of <i>Byt</i>.</p>
    <p>The short film consists of three parts.</p>
    <p>While they share the themes of time, domesticity, and everyday life, each part is edited according to a different type of rhythm.</p>
